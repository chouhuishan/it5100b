# IT5100A : Stream Processing

* 2025/26 Semester 1
* Lecturer: Foo Yong Qi

Repository to keep track of my progress.

## Getting Started

This repo uses `uv` to manage dependencies and virtual environment. Follow this [guide](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/) to set up `uv`. 


## Practice 

This folder is solely for my practice and understanding Haskell basics. Most of it was adapted from https://learnyouahaskell.github.io/chapters.html

To create virtual environment and install all dependencies, run: 

```sh
uv sync
```
